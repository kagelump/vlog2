Look at these two photos. Do they belong to the same scene or burst of shots?
They should be considered the same burst if:
1. They show the same subject in the same location.
2. They were taken in quick succession (which you can infer from lighting and subject position).
3. They are visually very similar.

Answer with a JSON object: {"same_burst": true} or {"same_burst": false}.
