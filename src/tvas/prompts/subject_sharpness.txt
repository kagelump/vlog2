Look at this cropped image of the {primary_subject}. Analyze the sharpness and focus of the subject.
Classify the blur level as one of the following:
- "SHARP": The subject is sharp and in focus.
- "MINOR_BLURRY": The subject is slightly blurry or soft, but still recognizable and usable, and fixable with postprocessing.
- "VERY_BLURRY": The subject is completely out of focus, blurry, or unrecognizable, and is not salvagable.
