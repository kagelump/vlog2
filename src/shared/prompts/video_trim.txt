Analyze the video to identify the "Best Moment" and necessary technical trims.
The "Best Moment" is the most aesthetic, interesting, or action-packed 3-5 second window in the clip.
Technical trims identify camera movement start/stop, blurry intros, reframing, or bad endings to find a stable usable range.

Respond in JSON format with the following fields:
- best_moment:
    - start_sec: Start time of the most aesthetic 3-5 second window.
    - end_sec: End time of the most aesthetic 3-5 second window.
    - score: 1-10 rating of how good this moment is.
- technical_trim:
    - trim_needed: Boolean describing whether or not trim is needed.
    - start_sec: Suggested stable start time in seconds (float).
    - end_sec: Suggested stable end time in seconds (float).
    - reason: A brief explanation (e.g. "blurry intro").
- action_peaks: List of timestamps (floats) where interesting action peaks occur.
- dead_zones: List of objects with start_sec and end_sec for boring or redundant ranges.
